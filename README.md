# SimpleNets

A repository I'm using to store neural network structures in an effort to figure out what I'm doing.

### Data
* `data/donquixote.txt` is from [Gutenburg](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/996/pg996.txt).

Props to:
* [nlintz/Tensorflow-Tutorials](https://github.com/nlintz/Tensorflow-Tutorials)
    * A great resource to get off your feet with Tensorflow. `./mnist.py` is largely derivative of his `03_net.py`; I just changed some variable names around, put the weights in a dictionary, and added a progress bar for vanity.
